            This Return, Refund and Cancellation Policy (&quot;Policy&quot;) sets out the terms and conditions under which Optimist (operated by OctoLife Climate Solutions Private Limited) accepts cancellation, return, replacement, or refund requests for products purchased through www.optimist.in, Optimist-owned retail stores, or authorized online marketplaces.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
            Optimist products are installation-based, large consumer durables, and therefore returns and refunds are governed by stricter verification processes compared to standard retail products. Customers are advised to read this Policy carefully before placing an order.

              Customers may cancel their order only if the order has not yet been dispatched from the Optimist warehouse. Once a cancellation request is received, Optimist will verify the dispatch status. If the product has not left the warehouse, the cancellation will be approved.

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Upon approval, the full order value (inclusive of taxes) will be refunded to the original mode of payment. Refunds are processed within five (5) to seven (7) business days, subject to bank processing timelines.

              Once the product has been dispatched, cancellation requests cannot be accepted under any circumstances. This is because the product is already in transit and assigned to logistics and installation workflows. Customers may, however, raise a return or replacement request only if the product qualifies under the conditions listed in Section 3 of this Policy.
